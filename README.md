### What I learned

This was a difficult project after returning to learning following a 2.5 week break. It was my first time using the picture elements, and stylying these took some getting used to. 

I did enjoy get to use a psuedo element in the button. 

### Continued development

I need to continue being more consistent with my practice, so I retain the knowledge I've learned without forgetting concepts.
I would also like to spend more time focusing on how to style the picture element, as the img sits as a different element inside it and requires extra steps to get it to look like I want it to.
